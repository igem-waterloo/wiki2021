                                Although it is very difficult to make our iGEM wikis and projects perfectly accessible to everyone due to certain limitations, there are many ways we can make it more accessible, and more inclusive. In this year's wiki, we have developed and completed our accessibility toolbar with an additional feature - the day and night mode. The accessibility toolbar can be enabled by mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts which are visibly displayed under each label.

                                We introduce the switch mode options, a simple toggle that lets users change the theme of the website into a darker colour. Exposure to light for a long period of time can suppress the secretion of melatonin, especially with blue light which is more strong at night, can do so even more effectively (Harvard Health Publishing, 2020). Moreover, the symptoms of digital eye strain can be caused through bright screens (Fottrell, 2018). Therefore, we want to implement the option of dark mode to help protect our usersâ€™ vision when browsing our wiki.

                                Easy navigation around a website is of the most important when it comes to designing a website. The cornerstone of web usability is navigation, and users can better navigate the website and discover information more quickly if it is well-designed.

                                We added the "up to the top" arrow options so that when the information gets too lengthy, users have the option to scroll up to the top of the page faster instead of manually scrolling up.

                                We want to introduce the chat bot feature of wiki, which conducts conversations without human intervention. The chatbot allows users to access all the necessary knowledge with keywords attached, leading to the information. We believe that the chatbot would offer convenience to the users with fast and efficient communication as to where things are and address their concerns on existing problems.

                                For our future wiki, we want to focus on the two main functions for our chatbot, which include:

                                    Searching for information: when users input a keyword, the chatbot will automatically return them a list of pages containing the keywords and allow them to click on the page from the conversation. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Contacting the team: the users can also send us messages/emails through the chatbot when they have any concerns or questions for our team.
                                </li>

                                Incorporating the human-like characteristics of the bot through programming. The chatbot's personality is built on its ability to keep a consistent tone of voice throughout the conversation. This entails carefully selecting the phrases used in a chatbot. It involves directing how our chatbot maintains interactions and responds to irrelevant or perplexing questions. The Chatbot personality helps define the user experience and is key to the way users interact and learn about our information.

                                Besides finishing the development of the chatbot, we want the future wiki to expand more on the functionality and characteristics of the chatbot. We want to highlight the efficiency of the chatbot as its transcript and analytics can be used to measure and improve interactions with website visitors and customers.
