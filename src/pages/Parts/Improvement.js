                    Streptavidin and biotin exhibit one of the strongest known non-covalent interactions, with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 10<sup>-14</sup> M (Chivers et al., 2011). However, streptavidin is tetrameric and rather bulky, making solubility and stability a concern in the context of a microfluidic assay. An engineered monomeric form of streptavidin exists, albeit at some expense of binding affinity, where the monomeric streptavidin and biotin interaction has a Kd of 10<sup>-9</sup> M (DeMonte et al., 2013). As a result, we sought to improve the affinity of monomeric streptavidin using computational rational protein design.

These mutations were able to decrease the individual energy of mSA2 by 62.925 REU (Rosetta Energy Units) compared to the unmutated mSA2, based on Rosetta's scoring function. As well, the energy score of the mSA2-biotin complex decreased by 1.8 kcal/mol, or 7.5 kJ/mol (on AutoDock Vina), corresponding to an increase in binding affinity.
